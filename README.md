Hello!

Our project is an LED-based piano teaching device. We want to have software that reads notes from a MIDI file, and have the notes show up on an LED strip. The notes that show up correspond to the order in which they should be played in. The BBG will be connected to a MIDI keyboard that can output the notes played by the user to detect whether they played a correct note, and to move on to the next set of notes if they do. Moreover, the sound of the individual notes can be heard when a user plays the key. The selected music can be changed by moving the joystick either left or right. The number associated with the song is displayed in the 14-seg display.
